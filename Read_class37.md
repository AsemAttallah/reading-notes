# Graph

## What is Graph data structure ?
* 'A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).'


## The Advantages of Graph :
* 'Representing complex data: Graphs are effective tools for representing complex data, especially when the relationships between the data points are not straightforward.'

* 'Network analysis: Graphs are commonly used in network analysis to study relationships between individuals or organizations, as well as to identify important nodes and edges in a network. This is useful in a variety of fields, including social sciences, business, and marketing.'

## The Disadvantages of Graph :  
* 'Limited representation: Graphs can only represent relationships between objects, and not their properties or attributes. This means that in order to fully understand the data, it may be necessary to supplement the graph with additional information.'
