# Linked Lists
## when we have a list then I want to make a chane like delete an item I need to make  many processes like delete item then make a shift in other and so on ofr each change delete or add and I take many time.
* To solve this problem: In python we look to the item in lists sepaterly as single units.And in each single unit I have a linked information with orther so when I want to delete item I just change a relation .

## What is linked list : it is a goup of nodes,each node include a data and next(which is like a pointer start from this node to next one)

## now we don't have an index to know what is the first item so we use (Head) to know what is the first item then by using next  we can continue moving  to other items But When we moving I don't mean the head when change its position (because if head do that it will change the start item that is mean I delete other one) to solve this problem we use

## (Current node) that will start from head then move to the next item to reach all  

## when I have a node with one pointer we call it (Single linked list)

## And when I have a node with two pointer we call it (Doubly linked list)
