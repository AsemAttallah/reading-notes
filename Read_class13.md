# Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

* ## 'Regression searches for relationships among variables. For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on their features, such as experience, education level, role, city of employment, and so on.This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represents one observation. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.Similarly, you can try to establish the mathematical dependence of housing prices on area, number of bedrooms, distance to the city center, and so on.Generally, in regression analysis, you consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that at least one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods.When implementing linear regression of some dependent variable 𝑦 on the set of independent variables 𝐱 = (𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ), where 𝑟 is the number of predictors, you assume a linear relationship between 𝑦 and 𝐱: 𝑦 = 𝛽₀ + 𝛽₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝛽ᵣ𝑥ᵣ + 𝜀. This equation is the regression equation. 𝛽₀, 𝛽₁, …, 𝛽ᵣ are the regression coefficients, and 𝜀 is the random error.'


# Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

## There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:
* Import the packages and classes that you need.
*       >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
* Provide data to work with, and eventually do appropriate transformations.
*       >>> x = np.array([5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55]). reshape((-1, 1))
        >>> y = np.array([5, 20, 14, 32, 22, 38])
* Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
*       >>> model = LinearRegression()
        >>> model.fit(x, y)
        LinearRegression()
        >>> model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y)
        
* Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
*       >>> r_sq = model.score(x, y)
        >>> print(f"coefficient of determination: {r_sq}")
        coefficient of determination: 0.7158756137479542
        >>> print(f"intercept: {model.intercept_}")
*       intercept: 5.633333333333329
        >>> print(f"slope: {model.coef_}")
        slope: [0.54]

* Apply the model for predictions.
*       >>> y_pred = model.predict(x)
        >>> print(f"predicted response:\n{y_pred}")
        predicted response:
        [ 8.33333333 13.73333333 19.13333333 24.53333333 29.93333333 35.33333333]
*       >>> y_pred = model.intercept_ + model.coef_ * x
        >>> print(f"predicted response:\n{y_pred}")
        predicted response:
        [[ 8.33333333]
        [13.73333333]
        [19.13333333]
        [24.53333333]
        [29.93333333]
        [35.33333333]]
*       >>> x_new = np.arange(5).reshape((-1, 1))
        >>> x_new
        array([[0],
       [1],
       [2],
       [3],
       [4]])

        >>> y_new = model.predict(x_new)
        >>> y_new
        array([5.63333333, 6.17333333, 6.71333333, 7.25333333, 7.79333333])
