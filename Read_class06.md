# How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

* ## The randint() Function: This function take two number as input arguments, for example:</br><code>import random</code></br><code>print random.randint(0, 5)</code></br>output (integer) : 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5

* ## The random() Function : this function used to generate random number 0 to 1 it will floating number, if you want to generate large number you need to multiply by large number.

* ## The choice() Function : This function used to take a random element from a collection object like: tuple, list. this function take argument the collection object and return one of its element.

* ## The shuffle() Function : This function take list as input argumentn the output is same list elements but in shuffeled order.

* ## The randrange() Function : This function used to generate a random number from a range, it takes three number as input argument (start,end,steps) and return the random number.

# In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
* ## 'risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test'
* ## To perform Risk Analysis there are three steps : <br/>- Searching the risk. </br>- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk.</br>- Measures for the risk identified.

# What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing? 
* ## 'Test coverage is a metric that specifies the quantity and quality of testing performed'.
* ## 'Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are'.
