# What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

* 'Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure'.

* 'Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more'.

# How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

* To get started with Vercel, it's helpful to understand projects and deployments.
* Next steps,to get started youâ€™ll create a new project by either deploying a template or importing and deploying an existing project

# What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
* PI stands for application programming interface. In essence, an API acts as a communication layer, or as the name says, an interface, that allows different systems to talk to each other without having to understand exactly what each other does.
