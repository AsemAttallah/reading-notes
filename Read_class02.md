# TDD (Test-Driven Development)
### What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python? 
* ### Test-Driven Development is focus on writing tests before writing a code. 
### How do they contribute to the overall quality of code? 
* ### By taking that tests as a guide to build a design of code.

# if __name__ == “__main__”

### Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts.
* ### we use this statement to check that we run a file directly or not.

### What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?
* ### when we want to check that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.

# Recursion 
### Describe the concept of recursion in Python.
* ### The concept of recursion mean the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly more times then stop in a specific condition  is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
* ### It is a different way to solve some problem instead of use looping.
