* Push : ' Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed ' .
* Pop : 'Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped.'  
* Top : ' This is the top of the stack ' .
* Peek :' When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised '.
* isEmpty : ' returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false ' . 


# Queue
* In queue we see a differente thing the last data add it will be on the  rear which the last node in queue each time, then if we want to delete the delete start the front which the first node in queue this what is happend in python.

* Enqueue : ' Nodes or items that are added to the queue '.
* dequeue : ' Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised ' .
* Front : ' This is the front/first Node of the queue ' .
* Rear : ' This is the rear/last Node of the queue ' .
* Peek : ' When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised ' .
