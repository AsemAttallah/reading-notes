# What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.

* ### 'In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ Object Initialization, To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder':
        class Account:
            """A simple account class"""

            def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
                """
                This is the constructor that lets us create
                objects from this class
                """
                self.owner = owner
                self.amount = amount
                self._transactions = []

# In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?

* ### The main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers' work It does not give credit to the people from whom it takes the code. The solution to the problem is by mentioning the original author of any work and mentioning other workers if possible, and not saying “this is my work” when in fact it was taken from someone else.
