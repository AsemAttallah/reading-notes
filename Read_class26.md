# Explain the role of Django’s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.
* 'Model: The model is going to act as the interface of your data. It is responsible for maintaining data. It is the logical data structure behind the entire application and is represented by a database (generally relational databases such as MySql, Postgres).'
* 'View: The View is the user interface — what you see in your browser when you render a website. It is represented by HTML/CSS/Javascript and Jinja files.'
* 'Template: A template consists of static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.'

# What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?
* 'Tailwind CSS is a low-level framework. Meaning, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesn’t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site.'
